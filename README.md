### Car Accident Severity Prediction Model
---
The final project for Stats 101C - Introduction to Statistical Modeling and Data Mining course at UCLA was a Kaggle competition. As part of a group with three other classmates, David Chabra, Kai-Li Chang, and Chan-Wai Wong, our group was tasked to train a model to predict the severity of car accidents in the form of a binary variable with a provided dataset.
